# Demoretia Framework (MVP)

Governance and policymaking function like a living ecosystem: starting from small seeds (local groups), growing into plants (community networks), and scaling into forests (regional/national/global). Roles are fluid, cycles are iterative, streams are fully transparent, and value delivery is incremental.
________________________________________

## 1. Ecosystem Metaphor
+ •	Seeds → Initial ideas / backlog items (policy cards, proposals, amendments).  
+ •	Sprouts → Prioritized Seeds chosen for a cycle (becoming Initiatives).  
+ •	Plants → Proposals that grow into Policies after refinement and collective input.  
+ •	Trees → Fully implemented Policies (equivalent to Epics delivered and made law).  
+ •	Roots → Value streams (tax streams, budgets, resources).  
+ •	Watering → Lean, crowdsourced allocation of budgets to initiatives (participatory budgeting).  
+ •	Harvest → Review of value delivered (policies implemented, outcomes measured).  
+ •	Composting → Lessons from failed or expired policies are recycled into new Seeds.  

## 2. Ceremonies (Cycles of Growth)

### 1.	Germination (Backlog Creation)
  + o	Citizens/participants submit **Seeds** (ideas, proposals, amendments).  
  + o	These live in an open backlog, visible to all.  
### 2.	Watering (Budget Allocation)
  + o	Seeds are evaluated for feasibility and assigned lean, crowdsourced budgets.  
  + o	Allocation comes from **Roots** (transparent tax/value streams).  
  + o	This ensures resources are tied directly to proposals from the start.  
### 3.	Sprouting (Prioritization & Selection)
  + o	Seeds are refined into Proposals/Initiatives.  
  + o	Communities vote or agree on which initiatives to **plant** in the next cycle.  
### 4.	Growth (Policy Development Cycle)
  + o	Initiatives are co-created using iterative methods (agile frameworks).  
  + o	At team level, artifacts may be handled like cards, stories, tasks, depending on context.  
### 5.	Voting Rounds (Implementation Decision)
  + o	Once an Initiative matures, it is voted in rounds:  
    - Round 1: Local or **Seed-level** approval.  
    - Round 2: **Plant-level** (community/regional).  
    - Round 3: **Forest-level** (national/global).  
  + o	A passed Initiative may become a Tree (Policy): signed into law by local reps or digitally ratified by majority vote.
### 6.	Harvest (Review & Outcomes)
  + o	**Trees/Policies** are evaluated based on measurable outcomes: did they deliver value to people and society?
### 7.	Composting (Retrospective)
  + o	Failed, outdated, or harmful policies are dismantled.  
  + o	Lessons learned feed new Seeds.

## 3. Artifacts in Demoretia Framework
Each artifact is both conceptual (intent) and practical (criteria).  

### 1. Seed 
  + •	Definition: Raw idea, proposal, amendment, or citizen submission.  
  + •	Threshold: Clearly expressed problem/opportunity + rough suggested direction.  
  + •	Acceptance Criteria:  
    - o	Transparent (authorship visible).  
    - o	Shared openly in backlog.  
    - o	Feasible at least in principle.  
  + •	Exit Condition: Moves to Initiative when refined with enough clarity and support.  
### 2. Initiative 
  + •	Definition: Refined Seed with community interest, resources considered, and clear intended impact.  
  + •	Threshold: At least minimal support (e.g., N% of community endorsements) + preliminary alignment with Roots (budget/value streams).  
  + •	Acceptance Criteria:  
    - o	Defined outcomes (what it aims to change or improve).  
    - o	Early validation (polls, experiments, evidence).  
    - o	Lean resource estimation.  
  + •	Exit Condition: Moves to Policy Proposal when voted and prioritized by Plant or Forest.  
### 3. Policy (Tree in Growth) 
  + •	Definition: Mature Initiative ratified at higher level (Plant/Forest) and undergoing drafting/implementation.  
  + •	Threshold: Passed through Voting Rounds 1 & 2 (local + regional).  
  + •	Acceptance Criteria:  
    - o	Formal draft language prepared.  
    - o	Aligned with Network Democracy principles (equality, ecology, transparency, justice).  
    - o	Sustainable funding from Roots assigned.  
  + •	Exit Condition: Ratified into Law/Rule via final voting (Round 3).  
### 4. Tree (Enacted Policy / Law)
  + •	Definition: Fully ratified Policy, implemented into law or organizational rules.  
  + •	Threshold: Passed Voting Round 3 (majority consensus or defined threshold).  
  + •	Acceptance Criteria:  
    - o	Clear implementation plan.  
    - o	Responsible stewards identified.  
    - o	Metrics for Harvest (impact evaluation) defined.  
  + •	Exit Condition: Reviewed in Harvest and Generational Review cycles.  
### 5. Amendment (Pruning & Composting) 
  + •	Definition: Modification or evolution of a Tree (policy).  
  + •	Threshold: Demonstrated need for change (data, feedback, ecological/equality triggers).  
  + •	Acceptance Criteria:  
    - o	Transparency of rationale.  
    - o	Citizen/community endorsement.  
  + •	Exit Condition: Recycles into new Seed → Initiative → Policy.  


## 4. Roles in a Self-Organized Citizen Framework
+ •	Citizens (Seed Voices):  
  - o	Core stakeholders, because taxpayers = funders.  
  - o	Every citizen can submit Seeds, endorse, and vote.  
+ •	Stewards (Facilitators):  
  - o	Ensure fairness, manage cycles, prevent gaming of the process.  
  - o	Elected or rotating, but with limited scope (no decision power, just facilitation).  
+ •	Pollinators (Connectors):  
  - o	Individuals or groups who move ideas between Seeds → Plants → Forests.  
  - o	Prevent siloing and help small Seeds find broader application.  
+ •	Guardians (Principle Keepers):  
  - o	Ensure Seeds/Initiatives align with Network Democracy principles (equality, ecology, transparency, justice).  
  - o	Could function like an “ethics review board,” but distributed and rotating.  
+ •	Treasurers (Budget Stewards):  
  - o	Manage Roots + Watering process transparently.  
  - o	Rotate regularly to prevent corruption.  
+ •	Forest Keepers (Meta-Councils):  
  - o	Coordinate Trees (Policies) at the macro level.  
  - o	Serve as alignment roles, not top-down rulers.  

## 5. Principle of Stability vs. Agility
+ •	Policies (Trees) are stable artifacts — once voted into law, they create certainty and trust.  
+ •	Iteration happens at the Seed → Plant → Tree pipeline, not by endlessly rewriting laws after they’re enacted.  
+ •	Amendments allow safe adaptation without destabilizing the entire system.  
+ •	This balances fast feedback cycles with the need for stability in governance.  


## 6. Scaling Model
+ •	Seed Level: Small teams test ideas.  
+ •	Plant Level: Initiatives scale, get cross-community buy-in, align with shared priorities.  
+ •	Forest Level: Large-scale policies ratified, coordinated across regions/nations.  
+ •	Roles-of-roles (Pollinators, Keepers) prevent centralization but allow scaling.  


## 7. Cycles in Demoretia

### 1. Micro-Cycles (Seed Sprints)
  + •	Length: 2–6 weeks.  
  + •	Purpose: Develop, refine, and test Seeds/Initiatives at the Seed level (local groups).  
  + •	Output: A refined Proposal or Amendment ready for “Voting Round 1.”  
### 2. Meso-Cycles (Plant Seasons)
  + •	Length: 3–6 months.  
  + •	Purpose: Communities (Plants) align their Seeds, prioritize Initiatives, assign budgets (Watering), and vote them forward.  
  + •	Output: Approved Initiatives moving toward Policy drafting.  
### 3. Macro-Cycles (Forest Cycles)
  + •	Length: 1 year.  
  + •	Purpose: National/Forest-level aggregation, cross-regional alignment, and ratification of Policies (Trees) into law.  
  + •	Output: Policies enacted, budgets allocated, measurable goals defined.  
### 4. Super-Cycle (Generational Review)
  + •	Length: 4–5 years.  
  + •	Purpose: Major review of Trees (Policies) for relevance, sustainability, ecological impact, and fairness. Outdated or harmful Trees move to Composting.  

## 8. Voting Cadence

### 1. Micro-Voting (Asynchronous / Continuous):
  + •	For Seeds → lightweight endorsement (likes, small votes, participatory polling).  
  + •	Citizens can “upvote” Seeds anytime (as in open source or DAOs).  
### 2. Meso-Voting (Seasonal: 3–6 months):
  + •	For Initiatives → formal selection rounds.  
  + •	Citizens prioritize which Initiatives move forward to become Policies.  
### 3. Macro-Voting (Annual / Forest cycle):
  + •	For Policies (Trees) → final ratification into law or charter.  
  + •	Requires larger quorum, higher thresholds, and stable legitimacy.  
### 4. Emergency Voting (On-Demand):
  + •	A separate fast-track mechanism (e.g., if an earthquake strikes).  
  + •	Citizens vote asynchronously with rapid quorum rules.  
  + •	Funded from “emergency watering pools.”  


## 9. Configurability of Language

### Option A: Political Context (Governments/Communities)
+ •	Seeds = Proposals / Amendments  
+ •	Initiatives = Bills / Motions  
+ •	Policies = Draft Laws  
+ •	Trees = Enacted Laws  
+ •	Roots = Tax Streams  
+ •	Watering = Budget Allocation  

### Option B: Unions / Worker Councils
+ •	Seeds = Member Proposals  
+ •	Initiatives = Bargaining Items  
+ •	Policies = Tentative Agreements  
+ •	Trees = Ratified Agreements / Union Policies  
+ •	Roots = Union Dues / Pooled Resources  
+ •	Watering = Participatory Budgeting  

### Option C: Boards / Cooperatives
+ •	Seeds = Ideas / Business Cases  
+ •	Initiatives = Strategic Proposals  
+ •	Policies = Governance Directives / Operating Rules  
+ •	Trees = Board Decisions / Charter Changes  
+ •	Roots = Revenue Streams / Budget Allocations  
+ •	Watering = Shareholder / Member Funding
